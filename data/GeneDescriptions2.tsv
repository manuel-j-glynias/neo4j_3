"Part of the TCR-CD3 complex present on T-lymphocyte cell surface that plays an essential role in adaptive immune response. When antigen presenting cells (APCs) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), TCR-mediated signals are transmitted across the cell membrane by the CD3 chains CD3D, CD3E, CD3G and CD3Z. All CD3 chains contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in their cytoplasmic domain. Upon TCR engagement, these motifs become phosphorylated by Src family protein tyrosine kinases LCK and FYN, resulting in the activation of downstream signaling pathways (PubMed:2470098). In addition to this role of signal transduction in T-cell activation, CD3G plays an essential role in the dynamic regulation of TCR expression at the cell surface (PubMed:8187769).

TNFSF4	OX-40L	T-cell Primed	Co-stimulatory	"TNFSF4 (OX40L), tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4, is expressed on antigen presenting cells and co-stimulates T-cells through binding of TNFRSF4 (OX40) to induce cell proliferation and survival of T-cells in autoimmunity responses (PMID: 28092803, PMID: 26215166). TNFSF4 (OX40L) fusion protein based therapies may stimulate TNFRSF4 (OX40) to activate T-cells in an antitumor response (PMID: 29545330, PMID: 29207606)."	"TNFSF4 (OX40L), tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4, is expressed on antigen presenting cells and co-stimulates T-cells through binding of TNFRSF4 (OX40) to induce cell proliferation and survival of T-cells in autoimmunity responses (PMID: 28092803, PMID: 26215166). "	"This gene encodes a cytokine of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family. The encoded protein functions in T cell antigen-presenting cell (APC) interactions and mediates adhesion of activated T cells to endothelial cells. Polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with Sjogren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Among its related pathways are ERK Signaling and Akt Signaling. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include signaling receptor binding and tumor necrosis factor receptor binding.	Cytokine that binds to TNFRSF4. Co-stimulates T-cell proliferation and cytokine production.
